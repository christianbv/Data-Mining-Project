# Data-Mining-Project
Data Mining Project as part of INFS4203 at University of Queensland.



You will be using the “ILPD (Indian Liver Patient Dataset) Data Set” data1
. The
data has 583 observations (rows) and 11 attributes (columns). The attribute in the
last column is a binary class variable with value 1 for “patient” and 2 for
“non_patient”. You may find and learn more detailed information about the data in
the data description page2
. 
Using the ILPD Dataset (Indian Liver Patient Dataset), which has 583 observations and 11 attributes. The attribute in the last column is a
binary class variable with 1 for "patient" and 2 for "non-patient". One task was to process this data, cluster it with different type of 
clustering algorithms and check if there might exist a subtype of the disease within the sick patients. 

Furthermore, the data was also used to train different classification algorithms, resulting in different results.
